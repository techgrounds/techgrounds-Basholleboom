### Resultaat
#### Exercise 1
Authentication - verifies who a user is  
Authorization - verifies what someone has access to  

##### three factors of authentication  
knowledge: something you know, like password  
possession: something you have, like id card or one time password token  
inherence: something you have, like fingerprint  

Principle of least privilege - user should only have access to things that are needed for their specific task. reduces risk of malware spread and reduces attack surface by only unlocking the minimal amount
